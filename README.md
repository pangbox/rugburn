# Rugburn :fire:
_This project is not endorsed by or related to Ntreev Soft Corporation. See [Trademark Notice](#trademark-notice) for more information._

Rugburn is a replacement for `ijl15.dll` that allows you to run unmodified PangYaâ„¢ without GameGuard.

This also allows you to run PangYa under Wine/Linux :)

To install, grab a binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/pangbox/rugburn/releases) page and follow the [installation instructions](#install).

See [Configuration](#configuration) for information on how to use it.

Features:

  * Redirects network traffic to localhost, configurable via a configuration
    file. Supports basic regular expressions for rewriting URLs.

  * Disarms anti-cheat software like GameGuard or HackShield.

  * Prevents PangYa from creating annoying topmost windows.

  * Sets `PANGYA_ARG` when possible to avoid the updater check.

  * Can be used as a relay for `ijl15.dll` or as a very simple patch for it.
    No need to modify or remove protection on `ProjectG.exe`.

  * **This program is not suitable for cheating. It does not support the only
    active region of PangYa and does not offer GameGuard emulation that would
    be needed to stay connected to an official server.** This program is
    designed for personal and educational use.

## Client Support

## Configuration
When running PangYa with Rugburn for the first time, a sample configuration
file is created at `rugburn.json`. It looks like this:

```json
{
  "UrlRewrites": {
    "http://[a-zA-Z0-9:.]+/(.*)": "http://localhost:8080/$0"
  },
  "PortRewrites": [
    {
      "FromPort": 10803,
      "ToPort": 10101,
      "ToAddr": "localhost"
    },
    {
      "FromPort": 10103,
      "ToPort": 10101,
      "ToAddr": "localhost"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can add `PortRewrites` to override and redirect Winsock2 connections,
whereas you can add `UrlRewrites` to rewrite WinHTTP requests.

### Custom Patches

You can specify custom memory patches using the `PatchAddress` key:

```json
{
    "PatchAddress": {
        "0x00d19ffc": "lobby_gbin\\x00"
    }
}
```

The keys are hexadecimal addresses for where to apply the patch, and the values are strings containing the data to patch at that address. A special form of hexadecimal escape is supported in the strings to allow raw data including NULL bytes to be present in the string. To use it, use a double reverse solidus followed by `x` and two hexadecimal digits. A single reverse solidus will be treated as a JSON string escape instead.

### Regular Expressions
Regular expression support in Rugburn is somewhat limited. The following
features are supported:

  * Capture groups (special characters `(` and `)`)
  * Character classes (special characters `[` and `]`)
  * Preset character classes (special escapes `\d`, `\D`, `\w` `\W`, `\s`, `\S`)
  * Dot match (special character `.`)
  * Zero or more match (special character `*`)
  * One or more match (special character `+`)
  * Optional match (special character `?`)

The replacement engine supports `$0` through `$9` in the replacement text to
refer to capture groups in the regular expression. Note that `$0` does not
refer to the entire match, since all regular expressions must fully match
anyways. `$$` can be used to escape a `$` in the replacement.

## Compiling
Rugburn is typically compiled with MinGW32. A Visual Studio solution is
provided for convenience and should work in most recent versions of Visual
Studio.

Prerequisites:
  * MinGW32
  * GNU Make

And all you have to do is run `make`.
```sh
make
```

And you should find an `ijl15.dll` in your `out/` directory.

By default, the Makefile will assume that `i686-w64-mingw32-g++` is the appropriate compiler. You can override this by passing in the `CXX` variable:

```
make CXX=g++
```
## Install

 1. Back up the `ijl15.dll` file in your PangYa directory.

 2. Copy `out/ijl15.dll` from your Rugburn directory to your PangYa directory, replacing the existing `ijl15.dll`.

## Usage
Once installed, you can run ProjectG directly. Enjoy!

## Troubleshooting
If you have any issues, I can **not** guarantee that I can help you. However, please feel free to create a GitHub issue. Please describe your problem and if applicable, attach a copy of the `gglog.txt` file.

## Contributing
I would be overjoyed if anyone wanted to contribute to this project! However, the project is considered _nearly_ feature complete and therefore new features may not always be accepted. Well-tested, well-written improvements to the patching routines would definitely be welcome.

Please note that I may take a while to get to your pull request. This project is not my fulltime job. Sorry!

## Why the name?
"Rugburn" was chosen arbitrarily, inspired by an anagram of GameGuard. Before release it was known as ijlshim or ggtfo, and you may see occasional references to this in the code or Git history.

## License
Most of the code of Rugburn is licensed under the ISC license. Some portions are licensed differently. See [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) for complete licensing information.

The long and short of Rugburn's license is that you are free to do with it what you please, although you should maintain the necessary copyright license disclaimers if you are reproducing a substantial portion of the program.

A copy of the Intel JPEG Library is included in the `third_party/ijl` directory. It is an unfree redistributable. For more information, see its [LICENSE.md](./third_party/ijl/LICENSE.md) file.

When compiled together with the Intel JPEG Library, which is what you get by default, the resulting binary is unfree but redistributable.

## Special Thanks
I would like to give special thanks to:

- The entire [Retreev](https://github.com/retreev) community for motivation and advice.

- Acrisio Filho for their many efforts; Rugburn contributions, many reverse engineering efforts, the SuperSS project, and more.

- pixeldesu for supporting and funding PangYa preservation efforts, and for a variety of PangYa reverse engineering efforts.

- You! I originally created Rugburn for myself only, but I am nonetheless pleased whenever I do see anybody interested in it. I hope that you will find it useful, whether for playing PangYa or for your own preservation endeavors, or perhaps even just as a curiosity.
